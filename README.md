## Next Steps: Planned Future Enhancements

- **Save the nominations:**
  ~~Currently, if the page is refreshed or if the user leaves the page, all the nominations are erased.
  Save the nominations to local storage and/or session storage.~~

- **Add a loading icon:**
  This will indicate to the user when the search is done. This will also only show the movie's posters when they are completely loaded.

- **Use toasts for notifications:**
  If an error occurs (ex. add/delete nominations), tell the user by using a toast.

- **Design for screens > 1440px:**
  Add another column in the movie search results for screens greater than 1440px.

- **Add movie suggestions when user searches a movie:**

- **Create links to the movie:**
  When the user clicks on the movie's poster/picture, it opens a new tab of the movie on IMDb's website

- **Make the movie and nomination cards the same height:**
